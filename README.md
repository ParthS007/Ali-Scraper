  All development goes on in this branch. If you're making a contribution, please make a pull request to _development_.
  PRs must pass a build check and all tests check on Travis.

This contains shipped code. After significant features/bug-fixes are accumulated on development, we make a version update, and make a release.

## Contributing

- Before you join development, please set up the system on your local machine and go through the scraper completely. Explore. (Don't worry ... Nothing will happen to the script or to you due to the exploring :wink: Only thing that will happen is, you'll be more familiar with what is where and might even get some cool ideas on how to improve various aspects of the extracting product details.)
- If you would like to work on an issue(if already created or create a new one [here](https://github.com/ParthS007/Ali-Scraper/issues/new):), drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.
